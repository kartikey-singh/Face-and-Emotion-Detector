# Face-and-Emotion-Detector
Developed a face and emotion detection system capable of classifying various types of emotions by the usage of HAAR cascade 
classifiers and Fisherface algorithm built in OpenCV.This application also implements various emojis ,quotes ,colours and sound 
techniques for enhancing the experience. 


This project is best suited for emotion recogniton for a single user's dataset.
